# R-PAL Interpreter
This project is an implementation of an R-PAL interpreter that processes and executes R-PAL programs using a sequence of components including a Lexical Analyzer, Parser, Standardizer, and CSE (Control Structure Evaluation) Machine.

## Components
1. **Lexical Analyzer**
This component tokenizes the input R-PAL program, breaking it down into a series of tokens that can be further processed by the parser.
2. **Parser**
The parser takes the tokens generated by the Lexical Analyzer and constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representing the hierarchical structure of the R-PAL program.
3. **Standardizer**
The Standardizer converts the AST into a standardized form, making it easier for the CSE Machine to evaluate the program.
4. **CSE Machine**
The CSE Machine executes the standardized AST, evaluating the program and producing the final output.

## Commands
You can run the R-PAL interpreter using the following commands:

### Specific Component Commands
```bash
make ast
```
- Runs only the Parser test and prints the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
```bash
make run_cse_machine
```

- Executes the program using the CSE Machine and prints the output.

### Build and Run Commands
```bash
make
```

- Runs all components: Lexical Analyzer, Parser, Standardizer, and CSE Machine, in sequence.
```bash
make run_lexical_analyzer
```
- Runs only the Lexical Analyzer test, producing the tokenized output.

```bash
make run_standardizer
```

- Prints the standardized AST after parsing.

## Getting Started
### Installation

- Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
- Ensure that you have make installed on your system.
### Running a Program

To run an R-PAL program, place the code in the designated input file and execute the desired command.

Use the specific component commands to test individual parts of the interpreter, or use the make command to run the full sequence.
